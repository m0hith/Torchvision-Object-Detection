### Introduction:
Torchvision is a popular computer vision library that is built on top of PyTorch. It provides several pre-trained models for tasks such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation.

In the context of object detection, Torchvision provides several models that are trained on large-scale datasets such as COCO (Common Objects in Context) and VOC (Visual Object Classes). These models are designed to identify and localize objects in images, and can be fine-tuned on new datasets or used to extract features from images.

Torchvision also provides several utility functions for working with object detection datasets, such as data loaders and transforms for data augmentation. Additionally, it provides tools for visualizing and evaluating object detection results.

Overall, Torchvision is a powerful tool for building object detection models, and can be used by both researchers and practitioners to develop state-of-the-art computer vision systems.
